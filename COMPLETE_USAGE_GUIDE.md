# 🎤 Complete Guide: Predicting Parkinson's Disease from Your Voice

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Record Your Voice
1. Find a quiet room
2. Use your phone or computer microphone
3. Say "Ahhhhhh" clearly for 3-5 seconds
4. Save as WAV file (e.g., `my_voice_2025_01_15.wav`)

### Step 2: Run the Prediction
```bash
cd scripts
python predict_disease.py
```

### Step 3: Follow the Menu
- Choose option 1 for single file
- Choose option 2 for multiple files
- Enter your file path when prompted

## 📊 Your Results Explained

### Example Output:
```
🎯 ENSEMBLE PREDICTION
   Predicted Class: HC_AH (Healthy)
   Parkinson's Probability: 0.183 (18.3%)
   Healthy Probability: 0.817 (81.7%)
   Model Agreement: 0.833 (83.3%)
   Risk Level: Low Risk

💡 RECOMMENDATION
   Low concern. Continue regular monitoring.
```

### What This Means:
- **18.3% Parkinson's probability** = Low concern
- **83.3% model agreement** = AI models mostly agree
- **Low Risk** = Continue normal life, monitor periodically

## 🎯 Risk Levels Guide

| Risk Level | Probability | Meaning | Action |
|------------|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Low Risk** | < 30% | Likely healthy | Regular monitoring |
| **Moderate Risk** | 30-60% | Some concern | Consider doctor consultation |
| **High Risk** | 60-80% | Significant concern | Recommend neurological evaluation |
| **Very High Risk** | > 80% | Major concern | Urgent medical consultation |

## 📈 Test Results from Your Data

Based on the analysis of test files:

| File | Prediction | Probability | Risk Level | Recommendation |
|------|------------|-------------|------------|----------------|
| `shashwat.wav` | Healthy | 18.3% | Low Risk | Continue monitoring |
| `vinayak.wav` | Parkinson's | 57.6% | Moderate Risk | Consider consultation |
| Sample files | Parkinson's | 94%+ | Very High Risk | Urgent consultation |

## 🔧 How to Use for Your Data

### Method 1: Interactive (Easiest)
```bash
python predict_disease.py
```
Follow the menu prompts!

### Method 2: Code (Advanced)
```python
from predict_disease import ParkinsonsPredictor

# Initialize
predictor = ParkinsonsPredictor()

# Single file
result = predictor.predict_single_file("my_voice.wav")
predictor.print_detailed_report(result)

# Multiple files
results = predictor.predict_multiple_files("my_audio_folder/")
```

### Method 3: Batch Processing
```python
# Analyze all your recordings at once
results = predictor.predict_multiple_files(
    "my_recordings/",
    output_csv="my_results.csv"
)
```

## 📁 Organizing Your Audio Files

Recommended folder structure:
```
my_voice_data/
├── 2025_01_15_morning.wav
├── 2025_01_15_evening.wav
├── 2025_02_01_followup.wav
└── results/
    ├── january_results.csv
    └── february_results.csv
```

## 🎙️ Recording Tips for Best Results

### Equipment:
- Any microphone (phone, computer, headset)
- Quiet room (minimal background noise)
- Consistent setup each time

### Technique:
1. **Say "Ahhhhhh"** clearly and steadily
2. **Hold for 3-5 seconds**
3. **Don't strain** - use comfortable volume
4. **Record multiple times** for comparison
5. **Same time of day** for consistency

### File Naming:
- Include date: `voice_2025_01_15.wav`
- Include time: `voice_morning_2025_01_15.wav`
- Include notes: `voice_after_exercise_2025_01_15.wav`

## 📊 Understanding Model Agreement

- **High Agreement (>80%)**: Multiple AI models agree = More reliable
- **Medium Agreement (60-80%)**: Some disagreement = Take multiple recordings
- **Low Agreement (<60%)**: Models disagree = Results less certain

## 🏥 Medical Considerations

### ⚠️ Important Disclaimers:
- **NOT a medical diagnosis** - This is a research tool
- **Consult professionals** for any health concerns
- **Don't make medical decisions** based solely on AI results
- **Use as supplementary information** only

### When to See a Doctor:
- **High/Very High Risk results** consistently
- **Changes over time** in your voice patterns
- **Other symptoms** (tremor, stiffness, balance issues)
- **Family history** of Parkinson's disease

## 📈 Tracking Changes Over Time

### Monthly Monitoring:
1. Record voice same day each month
2. Use same recording setup
3. Compare results over time
4. Look for trends, not single results

### What to Track:
- Parkinson's probability changes
- Model agreement trends
- Risk level progression
- Recording quality consistency

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"No models found"**
- Make sure you're in the `scripts` folder
- Check that `.pkl` files exist

**"Audio loading error"**
- Check file format (WAV preferred)
- Verify file path is correct
- Ensure file isn't corrupted

**"Low model agreement"**
- Record multiple times
- Check audio quality
- Ensure clear "Ah" sound

### System Requirements:
- Python 3.8+ installed
- 4GB+ RAM available
- Internet connection (first time only)
- Audio recording capability

## 📞 Getting Help

### If Results Seem Wrong:
1. **Record again** with better audio quality
2. **Try multiple recordings** and compare
3. **Check microphone** setup and positioning
4. **Ensure clear voice** without strain

### For Technical Issues:
1. Check all files are in correct locations
2. Verify Python installation
3. Ensure internet connection for first run
4. Try restarting the script

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

### ✅ Do:
- Record regularly for trend monitoring
- Use consistent setup and technique
- Consider results as screening tool only
- Consult doctors for concerning results
- Keep recordings organized with dates

### ❌ Don't:
- Rely solely on AI for medical decisions
- Panic over single high-risk result
- Skip professional consultation if concerned
- Use poor quality recordings
- Ignore consistent concerning trends
