- **Moderate Risk** (30-60%): Requires attention
- **High Risk** (60-80%): Strong indication
- **Very High Risk** (> 80%): Very strong indication

## Technical Specifications

### Audio Requirements:
- **Sample Rate**: 16 kHz (automatically resampled)
- **Duration**: 3 seconds (with 0.5s offset)
- **Format**: WAV files preferred
- **Content**: "Ah" sound vocalization

### Model Files Generated:
- `wav2vec_best_model.pkl`: Best performing model
- `wav2vec_scaler.pkl`: Feature normalization
- `wav2vec_label_encoder.pkl`: Label encoding
- Individual model files for each algorithm

## Example Results

**Test Sample Analysis:**
- **Single Model**: 94.1% confidence (Healthy)
- **Ensemble**: 79.2% healthy, 20.8% Parkinson's
- **Model Agreement**: 80% consensus
- **Risk Level**: Low Risk

This demonstrates the model's ability to provide nuanced, probabilistic assessments rather than binary classifications.

## Conclusion

The Wav2Vec2-based approach represents a significant improvement in Parkinson's disease voice detection, achieving ~80% accuracy with robust ensemble methods. While the current dataset is limited, the model shows promising results and provides a solid foundation for clinical applications with larger datasets.
